# Sudoku Samurai: Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions on how to deploy the Sudoku Samurai application to popular static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages and Netlify.

Because this project is currently set up to run in a **"no-build-step" environment**, the deployment process is simpler than that of a typical modern web application. We are essentially just serving a set of static files.

### Method 1: Deploying to GitHub Pages

This is the recommended method for easily sharing your project.

#### Configuration Steps:

1.  **Push Your Code**: Make sure your latest working code is pushed to your GitHub repository (`gamedesigns/Sudoku-Samurai-2`).

2.  **Navigate to Settings**: In your repository on GitHub, click on the **"Settings"** tab.

3.  **Go to Pages**: In the left sidebar, click on **"Pages"**.

4.  **Configure the Source**:
    -   Under the "Build and deployment" section, for the **Source**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**.
    -   A new dropdown menu will appear.
    -   **Branch**: Select your main branch (usually `main`).
    -   **Folder**: Keep the default option, which is **`/ (root)`**.

5.  **Save and Deploy**:
    -   Click the **"Save"** button.
    -   GitHub will automatically start the deployment process. Wait a minute or two, and a green banner will appear at the top of the Pages settings with the URL to your live site.

Your application is now live! Every time you push a new commit to your `main` branch, GitHub Pages will automatically update your live site with the latest changes.

### Method 2: Deploying to Netlify (or Vercel)

Platforms like Netlify offer a very similar and simple deployment process for static sites.

#### Configuration Steps:

1.  **Sign Up/Log In**: Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and log in.

2.  **Connect to GitHub**: Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account.

3.  **Add a New Site**:
    -   From your dashboard, click **"Add new site"** and choose **"Import an existing project"**.
    -   Select **"GitHub"** as your provider.
    -   Find and select your `Sudoku-Samurai-2` repository.

4.  **Configure Site Settings**:
    -   Netlify will ask for your build settings. Because we don't have a build step, the configuration is very simple:
    -   **Build command**: Leave this field **completely empty**.
    -   **Publish directory**: Set this to the root of your project. You can usually leave this empty or enter a single period (`.`).

5.  **Deploy**:
    -   Click the **"Deploy site"** button.
    -   Netlify will deploy your files, and in under a minute, it will provide you with a live URL for your application.

Like GitHub Pages, Netlify will automatically redeploy your site every time you push an update to your connected GitHub branch.
