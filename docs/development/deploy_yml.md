# Sudoku Samurai: GitHub Actions Workflow (`deploy.yml`)

This document clarifies the status of the `deploy.yml` file for this project.

---

### Status: Obsolete for Current Setup

In the process of developing this application, we initially explored using a standard build system (Vite, npm, etc.). A GitHub Actions workflow file (`deploy.yml`) is the correct way to automate the building and deployment of such a project.

However, to ensure the application runs correctly within the Google AI Studio's unique "no-build-step" environment, we have since removed the build system. The application now runs directly from `index.html` using a CDN for its dependencies and styling.

**As a result, a build-based GitHub Actions workflow is no longer necessary or functional for this project.**

### Recommended Deployment Method

The correct and much simpler way to deploy the application is by using GitHub Pages' **"Deploy from a branch"** feature. This method takes your source code as-is and serves it directly, which is perfect for a project without a build step.

**For detailed instructions on how to set this up, please refer to the official deployment guide:**
